# What is the content of this repository?
Cryptographic algorithms play a pivotal role in the Swiss Post Voting System: ensuring their faithful implementation is crucially important. The crypto-primitives library provides a robust and misuse-resistant library implementing some of the Swiss Post Voting System's cryptographic algorithms. We base our library upon a mathematically precise and unambiguous specification. Our pseudo-code description of the cryptographic algorithms - inspired by [Haenni et al.](https://arbor.bfh.ch/13834/) â€“ aims to bridge the representational gap between mathematics and code.

An essential part of the crypto-primitives library is the implementation of the [Bayer-Groth Mix net](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Groth/MinimalShuffle.pdf). Verifiable mix nets underpin most modern e-voting schemes since they hide the relationship between encrypted votes (potentially linked to the voter's identifier) and decrypted votes. A re-encryption mix net consists of a sequence of mixers, each of which shuffles and re-encrypts an input ciphertext and returns a different ciphertext list containing the same plaintexts. Each mixer proves knowledge of the permutation and the randomness (without revealing them to the verifier). The verifier checks these proofs to guarantee that no mixer added, deleted, or modified a vote.

## Under which license is this code available? 
The Crypto-primitives are released under Apache 2.0.

## Changes since publication in 2019
We re-implemented the Bayer-Groth mix net with the following objectives in mind:
* making the specification and the code easier to audit
* providing a misuse resistant library to the e-voting developers
* reducing the number of external dependencies and future maintenance costs
* laying the groundwork for future performance optimizations of mathematical operations


## Future work
We plan for the following improvements to the crypto-primitives library:
* Implementing non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs
* Optimizing mathematical operations using native libraries
